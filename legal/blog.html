				<div class="mainTextPlain">There are several concepts involved here:</div>
				<div class="textHolder"> <pre>
pool: This is the main component of Stratis. It consists of one or more block devices, and its total size is equal to the sum of the block device sizes.

blockdev: These are block devices on Stratus. The following block devices are supported here: 
1 hard drives and solid state drives 
2 LVM logical volumes
3 MD RAID
4 iSCSI
5 DM Multipath
6 SUITE

File system: A pool can contain one or more file systems formatted in XFS and used for storing files. Usually file systems have thin software. In other words, they do not have a fixed total size, and their size grows as data is stored on them.			
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">There exist many functions related to the Stratis pool, including:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage"><pre>
  Pool-based management
  Snapshots of the file system
  Monitoring
  Thin provisioning
  Tiering
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Startis allows you to create both encrypted and unencrypted pools. Encrypted pools are created on Stratis to increase security. When creating a pool of this type, the core keychain is used as the main encryption mechanism. After restarting the system, to access the pool, you must provide the created kernel keychain. In this guide, you will gain the necessary knowledge on how to use the Stratus encrypted pool with Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE). Stratus allows you to create both encrypted and unencrypted pools. Encrypted pools are created on Stratis to increase security. When creating a pool of this type, the core keychain is used as the main encryption mechanism. After restarting the system, to access the pool, you must provide the created kernel keychain.</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Necessary conditions: Block devices that are not used/mounted.In this guide, we will use several disks connected to the system.</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Define block devices using the command:</div>
				<div class="textHolder"><pre>

				<div class="textHolderAvarage">lsblk</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">After restarting the system, you will not be able to access the pool, to access it, you must provide the created kernel key. First recreate the key using the same key description.</div>

				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">This is quite convenient, but requires memorizing a bunch of keys. This can be simplified using NBDE as shown below.</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">To be able to bind an encrypted Stratis pool to NBDE, you need a Tang server. This Tang server will help unlock the encrypted pool without having to provide a description of the kernel keychain as described above. First install the Tang server:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">yum install tang</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Select any unused port and bind the service to it. For example, port 7500 as shown below:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">semanage port -a -t tangd_port_t -p tcp 7500</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Allow the specified port on the firewall:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">firewall-cmd --add</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Enable the tangd service:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">systemctl enable tangd.socket</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Create an override configuration file in /etc/systemd/system/tangd.socket.d/ using the command:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">syst</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Change the default port 80 to the new port as shown below:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage"><pre>
	[Socket]
	ListenStream=
	ListenStream=7500
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Restart the daemon and restart the service:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">sys</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Check if the service is bound to the new port:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage"><pre>
	systemctl show tangd.socket -p Listen
	Listen=[::]:7500 (Stream)
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Get a thumbprint of the tang server:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage"><pre>
	tang-show-keys 7500
	Mbe0_qFvUj7GRHXUp6g6yEQhixU
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Now bind the encrypted Stratis pool to NBDE using the command with the syntax below:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">stratis pool bind nbde &ltpool_name>  &lttang-server> --t</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Replace poll_name and tang-server accordingly.</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">To check if we can unlock the Stratis pool using NBDE, reboot the system.</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">reboot now</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">After a successful system reboot, switch to the root user.</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">su</div>
				<div class="textHolder"><pre>
	stratis pool list
	Name                        Total Physical   Properties                                   UUID
				</pre></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">In addition to unlocking the pool with a key, you can unlock it using NBDE (spike), as shown below:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">stratis p</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">You can agree that you no longer need to provide a keychain to access the pool.</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">Decoupling the Stratis pool from additional ciphers leaves only the main cipher of the core keychain in effect. Additional encryption can be associated with NBDE or TPM. To remove this binding, use the command with the syntax below:</div>
				<div class="textHolderavarage">stratis pool unbind clevis &ltpool_name>&lt/pool_name></div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">example:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">stratis pool unbind clevis pool1</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">After that, access to the pool can only be obtained using the primary encryption key of the kernel</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">To use the Stratis file system, it must be mounted. First create a mount point:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">mkdir /mnt/pool_1</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">You can perform a temporary file system mount using the command:</div>
				<div class="textHolderAvarage">mount /dev/stratis</div>
				<div class="mainTextPlain">To mount a file system permanently, start by defining the UUID of the file systems:</div>
				<div class="textHolder"><pre>

					<div class="mainTextPlain">Whatwaf is a security tool for web application information and detecting the presence of any WAF. This tool is useful for determining whether a web application is protected by WAF during a security assessment. If this is the case, circumvention and prevention strategies may be useful when further testing or operating the web application. <br> Install-Kali:</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage"><pre>

					<div class="textHolderAvarage">  ./whatwaf --help </div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">The WhatWaf firewall detection tool is easy to use. We just need to run the following command:</div>		
					<div class="textHolderAvarage"> ./whatwaf -u https://www.targetsite.com</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">We can also use the tor service to scan the WAF, but this may increase the latency. Just type (--tor) in the end of above command. <br>The main advantage of the WhatWaf tool is that it automatically tries to transmit the payload bypassing the detected firewall.</div>

					<div class="mainTextPlain">The most well-known tool for detecting web application firewall is Wafw00f. Wafw00f sends an HTTP request to the web application firewall to identify it. If sending an HTTP request fails, wafw00f makes a malicious HTTP request. If sending a malicious HTTP request fails, wafw00f examines previous HTTP requests and uses a simple algorithm to determine if the web application firewall is responding to our attacks.</div>

					<div class="textHolderAvarage">http://domain.com/REDACTED/news.php?id=13</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">When opening the URL, I encountered a MySQL error. Even from the Google dork output you can see it:</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">Warning: mysql_fetch_assoc() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean give in … on line 27</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">The error is very valuable to us because we know that we can perform some logical queries. Let's start the operation.</div>
					<div class="mainText"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">Analysis of website behavior</span></div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">I tried a few basic queries to see how the site behaves. When entering an incorrect request, 2 errors are returned (1 which was by default and another which was caused by us). <br>So we know that if our query is correct, we only get 1 error message, otherwise we get 2 error messages. Thanks to this valuable information (which took me some time), let's get the number of columns using an ORDER BY query.</div>
					<div class="mainText"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">Finding the number of columns with Boolean + ORDER BY</span></div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">Since the server is waiting for a logical operator, I can use the AND 0 query, however, some other logical queries can be used:</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">AND null <br> AND 1</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">Now let's add both a logical string and an ORDER BY query to our query. I always try to start by searching for a column with the number 1, because I am 100% sure that the site will not show any error.</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">http://domain.com/REDACTED/news.php?id=13 AND 0 order by 1-- -</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">We only get 1 error message (from the website, not because of our request). Now that we know that our query is correct, let's try increasing the number of columns by 1 until we get the second error.</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">
						?id=13 AND 0 order by 1-— - (shows 1 error) <br>
						?id=13 AND 0 order by 2 — — (shows 1 error) <br>

						?id=13 AND 0 order by 4-— — (shows 1 error) <br>
						?id=13 AND 0 order by 5-— — (shows 1 error) <br>
						?id=13 AND 0 order by 6-— — (shows 2 errors)
					</div>
					<div class="mainTextHolder">The second error message appears when we try to find the 6th column. So this means that the database has only 5 columns.</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">?id=13 AND 0 order by 6-— —</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">Before proceeding, let's make sure once again that there are 5 columns in the database.</div>

					<div class="mainText"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">Traversing the WAF and finding a column for the dump</span></div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain">Now we are sure because we don't get the second error. It's time to find which of these 5 columns will allow us to get the data using the UNION SELECT query.</div>
					<div class="textHolderAvarage">http://domain.com/REDACTED/news.php?id=13 AND 0 union select 1,2,3,4,5-- -</div>

The 34 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) mapped to Broken Access Control had more occurrences in applications than any other category. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A02:2021</span>-Cryptographic Failures shifts up one position to #2, previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, which was broad symptom rather than a root cause. The renewed focus here is on failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A03:2021</span>-Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were tested for some form of injection, and the 33 CWEs mapped into this category have the second most occurrences in applications. Cross-site Scripting is now part of this category in this edition. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A04:2021</span>-Insecure Design is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. If we genuinely want to “move left” as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A05:2021</span>-Security Misconfiguration moves up from #6 in the previous edition; 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it’s not surprising to see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part of this category. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A06:2021</span>-Vulnerable and Outdated Components was previously titled Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and is #2 in the Top 10 community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored into their scores. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A07:2021</span>-Identification and Authentication Failures was previously Broken Authentication and is sliding down from the second position, and now includes CWEs that are more related to identification failures. This category is still an integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems to be helping. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A08:2021</span>-Software and Data Integrity Failures is a new category for 2021, focusing on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted impacts from Common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017 is now a part of this larger category. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A09:2021</span>-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures was previously Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and is added from the industry survey (#3), moving up from #10 previously. This category is expanded to include more types of failures, is challenging to test for, and isn’t well represented in the CVE/CVSS data. However, failures in this category can directly impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics. <br>
						<span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A10:2021</span>-Server-Side Request Forgery is added from the Top 10 community survey (#1). The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage, along with above-average ratings for Exploit and Impact potential.

				<div class="mainTextPlain">This is one of the most popular security tools in the world. This is part of the OWASP community, which means that this tool is absolutely free. It is designed for users with a wide range of security experience, so it is great for developers and functional testers who are not familiar with pentests. <br> ZAP creates a proxy server between the client and your site. While you are navigating your website, it captures all the actions, and then attacks the site with known methods.</div>

					 <div class="activity spinning">|</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain">At startup, ZAP will prompt you to save the session. If we want to get the configuration of our website or test results later, then we should save the session, but for now we can choose the value: "No, I do not want to persist the session ...". <br><span style="color:#585858;">So what is the difference between active and passive scanning?</span><br>From the point of view of the penetration test, passive scanning is a harmless test that only looks for answers and checks them for known vulnerabilities. Passive scanning does not change the site data, which makes it more secure. // Active scanning attacks the website with various known methods. Active scanning can modify data and insert malicious scripts. Therefore, it is better to test sites that are deployed on a local host in this way. <br>Let's take a quick look at the ZAP UI layout to understand the basics. The next screen lists windows with 4 sections. <br>In the upper left corner of the screen you can see the modes, of which there are only 4:</div>
					 <div class="textHolder"><pre>
	Standard Mode: Allows you to do anything with any website.
	Attack Mode: actively checks any websites.
	Safe Mode: Disables all malicious functions during scanning.
	Protected Mode: Allows you to scan websites in a specific area. This prevents unwanted sites from being scanned.
					 </pre></div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain">the sites section will list all the sites that we access via ZAP. <br>"Show only URLs." It is advisable to enable this option, since after the first tests this section will be heavily clogged. To focus on the target website, you need to put the "In Scope" flag on it. <br>The workspace window consists of 3 tabs:</div>
					 <div class="textHolder"><pre>
	Quick launch window. This is the fastest and most direct way to start an active scan. Enter the address of the target website and click the attack button. First, it guards the website, and then performs an active scan.

	Request and response window. These are the most commonly used parts of the user interface. On the query tab, you can see that the window is divided into 2 parts:

	The top one shows the request header and cookies
	The lower one shows the parameters of the message sent to the server

	The response window is similar to the request window and shows:

	Heading
	Response body
					 </pre></div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain">The bottom window shows:</div>
					 <div class="textHolder"><pre>
	Results
	Request history
	Test vulnerabilities
					 </pre></div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain">The "Alerts" tab. Shows vulnerabilities found on the target website. When we click on one of the warnings in the list, the corresponding request/response opens in the upper right corner and displays accurate information about the vulnerability.  The POST request is executed at http://localhost:22742/api/TokenAuth/Authenticate . The user logs in with credentials and the server returns an http-500 error. HTTP-500 Internal Server Error. OWASP ZAP thinks this is a problem. And in the 3rd window you will see some information about it. It shows the exact URL and a yellow flag (medium risk). The description says: This page contains an error/warning message that may reveal sensitive information, such as the location of the file that caused the unhandled exception. This information can be used for further attacks on the web application. The warning may be false if the error message is on the documentation page. This is cool because OWASP ZAP feels some information leakage. He suspects that the website throws an unhandled exception. This can be really vulnerable when a website shows an attacker some exception stack and provides information about the environment or code. But in our example, the response is a JSON content that says "Invalid user name or password", but the developer prefers to send it via HTTP-500. This is a false positive, since no information is disclosed. <br>The solutions section contains information on how to solve the problem. <br>In an earlier version of OWASP ZAP, you had to configure your browser's proxy server to capture requests, but now there is a useful JxBrowser feature! It is a Chromium-based browser integrated into OWASP ZAP. By default, the entire proxy configuration is configured in it, which allows OWASP ZAP to pass all traffic through it. Click "Launch Browser" and go to your website. <br>To extract the website tree, you need to scan it in JxBrowser. You need to hit all the functions and go through all the possible actions. This stage is very important! Crawling a site means scanning all the links and getting the structure of the website. We have already written about other crawlers earlier. Why do we need crowling? Crowling is needed only in cases when it was not possible to access everything only with the help of navigation. It can detect moments that have been missed, as well as when proxying is not possible. To launch it, right-click on the site and select "Attack" from the menu, and then click "Spider". Make sure that there is a checkbox next to the "recurse" item! Click the "Start Scan" button. It will take some time depending on the number of links on your site. How to test a SPA (single page application)? If this is a SPA website, then you must additionally specify that the parameters represent the structure and not the application data. <br>If you cover all the functions and actions of your SPA site, you will not need to guard it. Owasp has added a platform of extensions, the list of which can be viewed using the icon of a 3-colored rectangle. To install the extension, click the Marketplace tab and enter the extension name in the field. Then click the "Install Selected" button. There is no need to restart ZAP. Several useful extensions:</div>

					 <div class="mainTextPlain">I recommend using the following scan settings. In the "Analyze" menu, select "Scan Policy Manager". Click the "Modify" button. In the "Scan Policy" window, set "Low" => "Threshold To All" and click "Go". The same as with Insane => Strength To All and press the Go button. All attacks will be stored in memory, and scanning will be more reliable. To save the settings, click Ok. <br>Attacking the target site is very simple. Add your site to the context. To do this, right-click the target website in the left pane. Select: "Include in Context", "Default Context". Now you can see that a new website URL appears in the popup window, which adds your website as a regular expression. An asterisk (*) in the URL indicates an attack on all URLs of this website. Finally, click OK. <br>Show only URLs in the current area. This way we hide other websites and prevent random attacks. Then we starting crowling and ATTACK! <br>This is the main goal. Let's start an active scan. The "Start Scan" button will start the process, which may take a long time (depending on the number of URLs). <br>Fuzzing is sending unexpected or random data to the inputs of a website. Usually we check the input data on the client side, so we ignore some problems in the server side. When fuzzy key data is entered (for example, the main search input on a website or the input data on the login page), coding errors and security loopholes can be seen. This is an optional security step. If you want to launch a fuzzer, then in the left part of the panel, find the request you want to process. Right-click and select "Attack", then click "Fuzz". The data for publishing the request will be visible in the fuzzer window. Click on them and select the text that we want to attack. On the right panel, click the "Add" button. You will see the Payloads window. Click the "Add" button again. In the "Add Payload" window, select "File Fuzzers" in the type list box. Select the file you want to use. This file is a database that will be used for bruteforce. Bruteforce sites on WordPress can be done by other methods, which we have already written about earlier. When the bruteforce process is over, the results will be listed on the bottom tab called Fuzzer. Those marked as Fuzzed require special attention. <br>The crawler searches for known URLs with organic links, but it cannot find a URL that is not mentioned anywhere on the site. In this case, forced browsing comes to the rescue, which uses bruteforce dictionaries to check if there are any other hidden URLs, such as the admin panel or something that can be hacked. <br>Break is a very good function for intercepting and modifying requests and responses. If you want to change any data of the request publication or response data, right-click on the site, select "Break", in the "Add Break Point" window click "Save". Now the bottom panel will show that the breakpoint is enabled. From now on, all requests will be intercepted by the OWASP ZAP tool. Whenever you make a request from the original website, the ZAP window is brought to the foreground and allows you to modify the request. After you click the green play button on the toolbar, ZAP will give you the response sent by the server. This answer can also be changed. This way, your browser will receive a modified response. <br>We have scanned the site well for known vulnerabilities and it's time to get acquainted with the results. You can see the problems on the "Alerts" tab located in the lower panel. The next screen shows 5 warnings with colored flags. If there is no red flag, then you are in luck. If there are red flags, then first of all it is necessary to work on their elimination. If no warnings are visible, something may have been done wrong. When you click one of the warnings, the corresponding request and response window is displayed. There is a good reporting tool that automatically creates a handy report file. You can export reports in the following formats: HTML, XML,JSON,Markdown. Let's choose HTML as an example. As you can see, this is a well-organized final report, which in its original form can be sent to any colleagueWe have scanned the site well for known vulnerabilities and it's time to get acquainted with the results.

					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>ccount Takeover (ATO) - hacker compromises credentials to gain access to a system, application, or user account.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>ddress Poisoning Attack (APA) - It is an attack that occurs by replacing the recipient's address with the victim's address. The hacker creates a transaction from his wallet, but substitutes the victim's address for the sender's wallet and puts an amount close to zero. Thus, the victim can receive a notification about the transaction, but will not know that it was not committed by her. The victim may inadvertently assume that she did this transaction herself and send the money to the fraudster's address.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>dversary-in-The-Middle (AiTM) - This is a type of cyber attack in which attackers try to take a position between two or more network devices. Using the functions of common network protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (for example, ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), attackers are able to intercept the data stream sent by the device and redirect it to their systems to collect information or perform additional actions they need.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>RP-spoofing/poisoning - a type of MITM-type network attack used in networks using the ARP protocol. It is mainly used in Ethernet networks. The attack is based on the shortcomings of the ARP protocol. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that allows network communications to reach a specific device on the network. ARP converts Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and vice versa. Most often, devices use ARP to communicate with a router or gateway that allows them to connect to the Internet.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>dvanced Persistent Threat (APT) - In an APT attack, a threat actor uses the most sophisticated tactics and technologies to penetrate a high-profile network. APTs aim to stay ‘under the radar’ and explore the network while remaining undetected for weeks, months, and even years. APTs are most often used by nation-state threat actors wishing to cause severe disruption and damage to the economic and political stability of a country. They can be considered the cyber equivalent of espionage ‘sleeper cells’.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>ttack Vector - An Attack Vector is the collection of all vulnerable points by which an attacker can gain entry into the target system. Attack vectors include vulnerable points in technology as well as human behavior, skillfully exploited by attackers to gain access to networks. The growth of IoT devices and (Work from Home) have greatly increased the attack vector, making networks increasingly difficult to defend.</div>
					 <div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">A</span>dvanced Threat Protection (ATP) - Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) are security solutions that defend against sophisticated malware or hacking attacks targeting sensitive data. Advanced Threat Protection includes both software and managed security services.</div>

					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>ring Your Own Filesystem (BYOF) - an attacker creates a malicious file system on his device containing a standard set of hacker tools for carrying out attacks.This file system is then loaded onto the compromised computer, providing the hacker with a pre-created set of tools to further compromise the Linux system.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>usiness Email Compromise (BEC) - this is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker gains access to the email account of a target organization through phishing, social engineering, or the purchase of credentials on the darknet.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>ring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) - a method of attack for which hackers use a harmless driver, which at the same time contains known vulnerabilities. Since such drivers have a signature, the OS allows them to be installed.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>luesnarfing - unauthorized access to information from a wireless device via a Bluetooth connection, often between phones, desktops, laptops and PDAs (personal digital assistant).</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>luejacking - Also known as Bluetooth spam attack, it is a technique in which an attacker sends anonymous text messages using Bluetooth enabled.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>lacklist, Blocklist, Denylist - is a basic access control mechanism that allows elements such as email addresses, users, passwords, URLs, IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc. through the system, except those explicitly mentioned which are denied access. Bot A Bot is a program that automates actions on behalf of an agent for some other program or person and is used to carry out routine tasks. Their use for malicious purposes includes spam distribution, credentials harvesting, and the launching of DDoS attacks.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">B</span>rute Force Attack - This is a method for guessing a password (or the key used to encrypt a message) that involves systematically trying a high volume of possible combinations of characters until the correct one is found. One way to reduce the susceptibility to a Brute Force Attack is to limit the number of permitted attempts to enter a password – for example, by allowing only three failed attempts and then permitting further attempts only after 15 minutes.</div>

					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">C</span>ache Cramming - this is a method of tricking the browser to run cached Java code from a local disk, and not from the Internet zone, so it works with less strict permissions.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">C</span>redential stuffing - this is a method of data theft that is used by attackers to access accounts on the Internet. It is based on the use of databases of accounts that were merged into the network as a result of earlier data leaks. By the method of automatic search, special software goes through the database and finds the desired login / password combination.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">C</span>ross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - an attack on users of web sites, in the framework of which the shortcomings of the HTTP protocol are used. When visiting a fraudulent resource, a request is secretly sent on behalf of the user to another server that carries out certain malicious activities (for example, transferring money to the account of fraudsters). To successfully carry out the attack, the victim must be authorized on the server to which the request is sent. Moreover, the request should not require confirmation from the user, since it can be ignored or forged by an attacking script. Among the applications of CSRF, the exploitation of passive XSS detected on another server is distinguished. In addition, it is also possible to send spam on behalf of the victim and change account settings on other sites (for example, a secret question for password recovery).</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">C</span>lickjacking - Clickjacking involves tricking someone into clicking on one object on a web page while they think they are clicking on another. The attacker loads a transparent page over the legitimate content on the web page so that the victim thinks they are clicking on a legitimate item when they are really clicking on something on the attacker’s invisible page. This way, the attacker can hijack the victim’s click for their own purposes. Clickjacking could be used to install malware, gain access to one of the victim’s online accounts, or enable the victim’s webcam.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">C</span>ryptojacking - Cryptojacking consists of hackers using the computing power of a compromised device to generate or “mine” cryptocurrency without the owner’s knowledge. Mining can be performed either by installing a malicious program on the target computer or through various kinds of fileless malware. Sometimes attackers take over part of the computer’s processing power when a page containing a special mining script is opened. Cryptojacking has been known to occur when viewing online ads or solving a CAPTCHA.</div>

					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>CShadow - this is a late-stage chain of destruction attack that allows an attacker with privileged credentials to register a "fraudulent" domain controller in order to send changes to the domain through domain replication. Embedded replicated events are logged, processed, and recorded as valid domain replication. As a result, an attacker can make changes through replication in a way that is very difficult to detect.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>CSync - this is an attack that allows an attacker to simulate the behavior of a domain controller (DC) and extract password data through domain replication. The classic use of DCSync is a precursor to the Golden Ticket attack, since it can be used to get a KRBTGT hash.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>DOS - distributed denial of service attack, which is one of the most common and dangerous network attacks. As a result of the attack, the service of legitimate users, networks, systems and other resources is disrupted or completely blocked. DDoS attack consists in continuous access to the site from many computers located in different parts of the world. In most cases, these computers are infected with viruses that are managed centrally by scammers and combined into one botnet (botnet). Computers that are part of the botnet send spam, thus participating in DDoS attacks.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>ead Drop Resolver (DDR) - an attack technique in which attackers place content with embedded malicious domains or IP addresses on legitimate web services, trying to hide their intentions. The malicious code does not contain the address of the C&C server - instead, the program accesses a post published in a public service and reads from it a string of characters that at first glance seem meaningless. In fact, this is encrypted information that serves to activate the next stage of the attack.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>ynamic linker hijacking (DLH) - Attackers can execute their own malicious payloads by intercepting environment variables that the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. On Linux and macOS, intercepting dynamic linker variables can grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. This method can also avoid detection by security products because the execution is masquerading as a legitimate process.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>NS Hijacking - Attacker changes the IP address of a resource using malware and redirects the victim to a compromised server controlled by the criminal instead of the requested site. Internet service providers intercept DNS to collect statistics and display ads. In addition, DNS service providers can use traffic interception as censorship to prevent access to certain pages.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>LL Injection - a method used to run code in the address space of another process, forcing it to load a malicious DLL library. For example, embedded code can intercept system function calls or read the contents of password text fields.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>rive-By Download - during this attack, a malicious file is quietly downloaded from the browser to the target system without the victim's knowledge. The file can be downloaded through advertising, a floating frame (iframe) or a malicious script embedded in the site.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>LL Sideloading - interception of the DLL library that the program loads. Instead of simply installing the DLL in the order of the program search and then waiting for the victim application to be called, the attacker directly loads his payload by installing and then running a legitimate application that executes his payload.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">D</span>omain Shadowing - this is a method of compromise, which involves hacking the domain administrator account and creating many subdomains in it in order to bypass the blocking by lists. Malicious pages linked to these URLs are hosted on the servers of criminals and are not connected in any way with the hacking victim's web resource (there are no links to them on the pages of the main site).</div>

					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">F</span>ileless Malware - Fileless Malware (FM), aka “non-malware,” or “fileless infection,” is a form of malicious computer attack that exists exclusively within the realm of volatile data storage components such as RAM, in memory processes, and service areas. This differentiates this form of malware from the classic memory-resident virus which requires some contact with non-volatile storage media, such as a hard disk drive or a thumb drive. Normally picked up following visits to malicious websites, fileless malware does not exist as a file that can be detected by standard antivirus programs. It lurks within a computer’s working memory and is exceptionally difficult to identify. However, this type of malware rarely survives a computer reboot, after which the computer should work as it did prior to infection.</div>

Cybercriminals embed a special script in a banner, or redirect users who click on an ad to a special page containing code for downloading malware. Special methods are used to bypass large ad network filters and place malicious content on trusted sites. In some cases, visitors do not even need to click on a fake ad — the code executes when the ad is displayed.</div>
					<div class="mainTextPlain"><span style="color: rgb(199, 0, 0);">M</span>an-in-the Middle Attack (MITM) - is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. For example, a victim believes he’s connected to his bank’s website and the flow of traffic to and from the real bank site remains unchanged, so the victim sees nothing suspicious. However, the traffic is redirected through the attacker’s site, allowing the attacker to gather any personal data entered by the victim (login, password, PIN, etc.).</div>

It includes the theft of passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, and other confidential information. Phishing messages usually take the form of fake notifications from banks, providers, e-pay systems, and other organizations. The phishing attempt will try to encourage a recipient, for one reason or another, to enter/update personal data. Common reasons given can include “suspicious login to the account,” or “expiration of the password.”</div>
