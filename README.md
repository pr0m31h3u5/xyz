# xyz
soon all my work, as well as interests, 
thoughts and much more related to my profession will be published on my website pr0m31h4u5.xyz 
in the blog section. 
Since github serves for me as a means of transmitting information, and not a social network for promotion,
I'm going to publish all further work only in private repositories, you can view the originals on the above site.
